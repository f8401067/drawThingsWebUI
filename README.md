# DrawThings WebUI

> **Latest Version**: v1.0.3 (2026-04-12)

[🇨🇳 中文版本](README_CHINESE.md)

A DrawThings Web interface based on Python Flask and static HTML, with an attractive and user-friendly interface that is convenient for mobile operation.

Used to remotely operate DrawThings on Mac for image generation and viewing images (if using external network environment, you need to set up networking yourself).

**Note: You need to install DrawThings yourself, and enable the HTTP Server function in Advanced settings when DrawThings can generate images normally**

## 🚀 Quick Start

### macOS Users (Recommended)

1. **Download Application**
   - Get the `DrawThings_WebUI_MacOS.zip` file

2. **Extract and Launch**
   ```bash
   # 1. Extract zip file to any directory (e.g., Desktop, Documents, etc.)
   # 2. Ensure Launch_DrawThings_WebUI.command and DrawThings WebUI.app are in the same directory
   # 3. Double-click Launch_DrawThings_WebUI.command
   ```
   
   **Notes:**
   - A Terminal window will open to display logs after launch
   - First launch requires a few seconds for initialization
   - **Do not close the Terminal window**, otherwise the application will stop running

3. **Automatic Configuration**
   - First launch will automatically create configuration files and data directories in the same level directory
   - **Important: Do not delete the data directory when updating versions**
   - Browser automatically opens http://localhost:9898

4. **Modify Configuration** (Optional)
   - Edit `config.json` directly in the same directory as the `.app` package
   - Restart the application for changes to take effect

**Advantages:**
- ✅ No Python installation required
- ✅ Ready to use out of the box
- ✅ Configuration files are easy to access and edit
- ✅ Runs independently, no dependency on system environment

---

### Access Application

After the service starts, access in browser:
- **Home Page**: `http://localhost:9898` (or your specified port)
- **History**: `http://localhost:9898/history.html`

## 📖 Usage Instructions

### Basic Usage

1. Open browser and access `http://localhost:9898`
2. The page will automatically check DrawThings server status
3. Fill in generation parameters:
   - **Prompt**: Describe the image content you want to generate
   - **Image Size**: Select from preset sizes
   - **Seed**: Random seed (-1 means random)
   - **Negative Prompt**: Content you don't want to appear in the image
   - **Steps**: Generation steps, more steps mean better quality but slower speed
4. Click the "Generate Image" button
5. Wait for generation to complete (may take a few minutes)
6. View the generated result, you can zoom in, zoom out, and save the image
7. Click "Return to Regenerate" to generate again

---

### NSFW Auto Detection

When LLM service is configured, the system will automatically detect content safety:

1. **Auto Detection**: After image generation completes, the system will use LLM to analyze prompt content
2. **Real-time Warning**: If NSFW content is detected, a warning window will pop up to alert users
3. **Auto Tagging**: NSFW images will be tagged in the database, and can be selectively displayed in history
4. **Privacy Protection**: NSFW images are hidden by default, requiring manual toggle to display

Configuration method: Add LLM-related configuration in `config.json`:
```json
{
  "llm_api_url": "http://your-llm-server/v1/chat/completions",
  "llm_model": "your-model-name",
  "llm_api_key": "your-api-key"
}
```

---

### Thumbnail Feature

To improve image loading speed when accessing history pages from external networks, the system supports thumbnail functionality:

1. **Auto Thumbnail Generation**: After image generation completes, the system automatically generates thumbnails (approximately 300x300 pixels)
2. **Quick Preview**: History page prioritizes loading thumbnails, only loads full-size original images when clicked
3. **Bandwidth Savings**: Thumbnails are typically only 1-2% the size of original images, significantly reducing network traffic
4. **Loading Acceleration**: In external network environments, thumbnail loading is 80-100 times faster than original images

Configuration method: Customize thumbnail parameters in `config.json`:
```json
{
  "thumbnail": {
    "max_size": [300, 300],
    "quality": 85,
    "format": "JPEG"
  }
}
```

**Configuration Item Descriptions:**
- **max_size**: Thumbnail maximum size [width, height], default [300, 300]
  - Recommended range: [150, 150] ~ [600, 600]
  - Larger means clearer but also larger file size
  
- **quality**: JPEG/WEBP compression quality (1-100), default 85
  - Lower values (60-75): Smaller files, slightly lower quality
  - Medium values (80-90): Balanced choice (recommended)
  - Higher values (90-100): Better quality, larger files
  
- **format**: Output format, supports "JPEG", "PNG", "WEBP"
  - **JPEG** (recommended): Small volume, suitable for photo-type images
  - **PNG**: Lossless compression, larger volume, suitable for line drawings
  - **WEBP**: Modern format, smallest volume, slightly less compatible

**Migrate Existing Data:**
If you already have generated images but no thumbnails, you can run the migration script:
```bash
python scripts/migrate_add_thumbnails.py
```

### History Management

Access `http://localhost:9898/history.html` to enter the history page:

#### Browser Cache Feature
- **Auto Cache**: Images are automatically cached to browser after first visit, second visit loads instantly
- **Smart Strategy**: Prioritize loading from cache, silently update in background to keep fresh
- **Capacity Management**: Maximum 50 images cached, automatically cleans oldest
- **Offline Browsing**: Can still access cached images when network is disconnected
- **Cache Management**: Can view cache status and clear cache in filter panel

#### Rating Feature
- **Star Rating**: Click stars (★) to rate images 1-5 stars
- **Bad Marking**: Click "👎 Bad" button to mark disliked images
- **Cross-user Rating**: Can rate images from any user

#### Filter Feature
- **Date Filter**: Select specific dates to view history
- **Star Filter**: Supports multiple selection, can select multiple ratings simultaneously
- **NSFW Filter**: Can choose to show or hide NSFW content
- **User View**: Toggle between "Only Mine" or "View All Users"

#### Batch Cleanup
- **Delete Bad Images**: In Bad filter state, can one-click delete all images marked as Bad
- **Safety Mechanism**: Must be in Bad filter state before executing delete operation
- **Dual Cleanup**: Simultaneously deletes database records and original files, freeing storage space

## ⚠️ Precautions

### Basic Requirements
- Ensure DrawThings service is started before first run
- Image generation may take a long time (about 5 minutes)
- Generated images will be saved in `data/generated_images` directory
- User inputs are automatically saved to browser local storage

### NSFW Detection Feature
- Requires LLM service configuration to enable automatic NSFW detection
- Detection results depend on LLM model accuracy
- NSFW images are hidden by default to protect privacy and compliance
- Can manually show/hide NSFW content through toggle on history page

### Rating and Filtering
- Rating data is stored in SQLite database, regular backup recommended
- Star filter supports multiple selection, flexible combination of different ratings
- Bad image deletion operation is irreversible, please operate with caution
- Cross-user rating feature allows multi-user collaborative review

### Performance Optimization
- For large amounts of history, paginated loading is recommended
- Regular cleanup of Bad images and unnecessary records can improve query performance
- **Browser Cache**: Images are automatically cached after first visit, second visit speed increases 20-50 times
- **Thumbnail Feature**: Enabling thumbnails can greatly improve external network access speed, reducing traffic consumption by 98%

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

### NSFW Detection Not Working?
1. Check if LLM-related parameters are correctly configured in `config.json`
2. Confirm if LLM service is running normally and accessible
3. Check backend console for error logs

### Rating Feature Abnormal?
1. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
2. Verify if API requests are sent successfully

### History Loading Slow?
1. Use date or star filters to reduce data volume
2. Regularly clean up unnecessary history records
3. **Utilize Browser Cache**: Images are cached after first visit, second visit loads instantly
4. **Enable Thumbnail Feature**: Configuring thumbnails can greatly improve external network access speed

### Thumbnails Not Generated?
1. Confirm Pillow library is installed: `pip install Pillow`
2. Check if `data/thumbnails/` directory exists and has write permissions
3. Check log file `data/logs/image_generation.log`
4. For existing images, run migration script: `python scripts/migrate_add_thumbnails.py`
